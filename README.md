# QIS102

This repository includes code exercises produced during the course QIS102: Applied Quantum Computing. The course resulted in a certificate attesting to my abilities in quantum and scientific computing presented by Brookhaven National Laboratories. This course was put together by the Co-Design Center for Quantum Advantage, and all code was produced in Python and Qiskit, IBMs an open-source quantum software development kit (Python-based).
